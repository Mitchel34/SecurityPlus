            <p class="body">
                7-Layered approach to networking. Security can be placed in between each layer.
                The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed as a way
                to help disparate computing systems communicate with each other.

        <div class="subTopic">Basic Network Devices
            <div class="content">Switch
                <p class="body">A switch utilizes an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip and is
                    considered
                    a Layer 2 OSI device.
                    The ASIC chip has specific programing that allows the switch to learn when a device is on the
                    network and which ports it is
                    connected to via that device's Layer 2 MAC address.<br>
                    Managed switches allow security to be placed on the individual switch ports creating amore secure
                    networking enviornment. <br>
                    A switch will only communicate with local network devices.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Wireless Access Point (WAP)
                <p class="body">A WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects (bridges) wireless network
                    segments with
                    wired network segments and is considered a Layer 2 OSI device.<br>
                    The most common type of WAP bridges 802.11 wireless network segments with 802.3 ethernet network
                    segments.<br>
                    All WAP's are capable of utilizing encryption to help ensure a secure networking envionrnment.<br>
                    A WAP will only communicate with local network devices.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Multilayer Swtch (MLS)
                <p class="body">An MLS provides normal Layer 2 network switchig services, but it will also proved Layer
                    3
                    or higher OSI model
                    services. <br>
                    The most common MLS is a Layer 3 switch. <br>
                    It not only untilizes and ASIC chi for switching, but the ASIC chip is also programmed to handle
                    routing functions.
                    This allows the device to communicate and pass data to non-local network devices</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Router
                <p class="body">The Router is the most common network device for connecting different networks together
                    utilizing the OSI
                    model's Layer 3 logical network information. <br>
                    The router uses software programming for decision making, as compared to the switch;s use of an ASIC
                    chip. <br>
                    Firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) are commonly placed on routers to help secure networks.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Firewalls
                <p class="body">A firewall can be placed on routers or hosts (software based) or an be its own device
                    (network appliance)<br>
                    It functions at multiple layers of the OSI model (Usually 2,3,4,and 7)<br>
                    It blocks packets from entering or leaving the network via stateless inspection and stateful
                    inspection. <br>
                    Stateless Inspections: the fire wall will examine every packet against a set of rules. Once the
                    packet matches a rule, the rule
                    is enforced, and the specified action is taken.<br>
                    Stateful Inspections: The firewall will only examine the state of the connection between networks.
                    Specifically, when a connection
                    is made from an internal network to an external, the firewall will not exammine any packets
                    returning from the external connection.
                    As a general rule, external connections are not allowed to be initiated with the internal
                    network.<br>
                    It is the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats. (consider
                    it the police force of the network)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Load Balancer
                <p class="body">A load balancer may also be called a content switch or content filter. <br>
                    Can be implemented to increase the security of the network by limiting or filtering the content that
                    is allowed. <br>
                    A network appliance that is used to load balance between multiple hosts that contain the same
                    data-spreading out the
                    workload for greater efficiency.<br>
                    Commonly used to distribute the requests (workloads) to a server farm among the various servers,
                    helping to ensure
                    that no single server gets overloaded.

            </div>
            <div class="content"> Proxy Server
                <p class="body">A proxy server is an appliance that requests resources on behalf of client machines.<br>
                    It is often used to retrieve resources from outside untrusted networks on behalf of the requesting
                    client. <br>
                    It hides and protects the requesting client. <br>
                    It can also be utilized to filter allowed content. <br>
                    It can increase network performance by caching commonly requested web pages.

        <div class="subTopic">Layered Security Concept
            <div class="content">Layered Security Concept
                <p class="body"> Modern networks are composed of multiple layers of devices and applications, which can
                    lead to issues with security.<br> While this does make the issue of security more complex, it has
                    the
                    benefit of supporting the concept of layered security (which is also called security in depth.) <br>
                    Each layer or device can contain its own security methods. This means that if a breach occurs in one
                    area of the network, the rest of the network will remain secure (hopefully). <br>It is a best
                    practice to use a layered approach when implementing network security.<br> Many security devices are
                    triggered by a specific action occuring (e.g., a network packet crosses an interface).<br> This
                    creates a situation in which those devices are only capable of reacting to perceived threats.<br> On
                    the other hand, some devices are capable of application awareness. This feature allows security
                    devices to make better decisions based on which applications are alled to operate on the network and
                    which applications are not allowed to cross through it. This is another layer that can be added to
                    the network's security. Some devices that may be application aware include firewalls, proxy servers,
                    and network intrusion detection/prevention systems.

            <div class="content">VPN Concentrator (Virtual Private Network)
                <p class="body">A virtual private network (VPN) concentrator will facilitate multiple secure VPN
                    connections to a network. <br> The type of VPN connection to the network will determine what
                    tunneling and encryption the VPN concentrator will implement. Most concentrators can function at
                    multiple layers of the OSI model (2, 3, 7). <br> Outside of Internet transactions (which use SSL,
                    VPN connections at Layer 7), most concentrators will function at the network layer (Layer 3) of the
                    OSI model, providing IPsec encryption through a secure tunnel.
                </p>

            <div class="content">Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
                <p class="body">A NIDS is a passive system designed to identify when a network breach or attack against
                    the network is occuring.<br> Usually designed to inform a network administrator when a breach or
                    atack has occured through log files, SMS, and/or and email notification.<br>A NIDS cannot prevent or
                    stop a breach or attack on its own. <br> It receives a copy of all traffic and evaluates it against
                    a set of standards.<br>Signature Based: evaluates network traffic for known malware or attack
                    signatures.<br>Anomaly Based: evaluates network traffic for suspicious changes. <br> Policy Based:
                    evaluates network traffic against a specific declared security policy. <br> Heuristic Based:
                    evaluates network traffic against past network behavior (looks for changes in expected patterns).
                    <br>A NIDS deployed at the host level is called a Host Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS).

            <div class="content">Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)
                <p class="body">Network Based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS).<br> A NIPS is an active system
                    designed to stop a breach or atack from succeeding in damaging the network. <br>Usually designed to
                    perform an action or set of acions to stop malicious activity.<br> Will inform a network admin
                    through the use of log files, SMS, and/or email notification. <br> All traffic on the network

                    is evaluated against a set of standards. <br> The best placement on the network is between a router
                    (with a firewall) and the destination network segment. <br> It is programmed to make an active

            <div class="content">Risks of Integration:
                <p class="body">There are multiple reasons why systems and data may be integrated with third parties.
                    The key is to know the risks. Systems and data may be required to be intedgrated because of a joint
                    venture with another entity. When implementing a cloud computing soluction, there will be a need to
                    integrate systems and data. In some cases, the need for integration is well known and intentional,
                    while, in other cases, it may not even be recognized as happening. When people are using social
                    media, they may actually be integrating company data with a third party. In all cases, there are
                    risks, associated with integration of systems and data with third parties.

                    may be vulnerable. The other side of the integration may not be secure. The third party may go out
                    of buisiness.

                    process. Implementing an identity accessmanagement (IAM) system can help ease the burden. Procedures
                    and systems also need to be put in place to remove access once the partnership is terminated or
                    authorized person leaves the buisness partner --the offboarding process.

                <p class="body">Due to improvements in modern network security methods, hackers may not be able to
                    easily exploit network resources. As these security improvements have developed, in many cases
                    attackers have shifted their focus to application attacks. The hacker will focus on exploiting
                    weaknesses in the software and operating systems that people use everyday. In many cases, the
                    security used to protect software and from exploitation is not as robust as the security that is
                    used to protect newtworks. A poorly developed application can often give the hacker Administrative
                    control of a system if the exploit is executed properly.

                    commands into the application, usually from an input field, knowing that the application will pass
                    the command to the database application. The injected SQL co mmands will then modify the
                    database (e.g., inserting new username and password for the hacker to use in further exploitation).

                    job. The problem lies with zero day attacks. Zero day attacks take advatage of either new or very
                    recently discovered vulnerabilities in applications, which means that networks and systems probably
                    haven't yet been hardened against them. The unfortunate reality is that attacks keep changing and
                    security experts must also be willing to adapt in order to keep pace.

                    Most attacks against applications involve exploiting outside input to the applications. By using
                    proper data validation techniques, application developers can stop most application attacks from
                    succeeding. All data validation techniques should be thoroughly tested by the developer to ensure
                    that they are effective. It is even advisable to have an unaffiliated person or organization attempt
                    to bypass the validation techniques in order to increase the effectiveness of the testting.

                    be a mix. Some departments may use IaaS, while a development team utilizes a PaaS only. Part of the
                    advantage of cloud computing is only initializing resources as they are needed. In a private cloud
                    situation, it is possible for the organization tha is using it to actually own the cloud resourves.
                    If they do own the cloud resourves, they may have it on site, or they may pay to have the resources

                    confidentiality. When the resources are out of physical control of the company, it may be difficult
                    to control access to those resources. In somesituations --such as when a law requires a company to
                    maintain physical control of the resources --cloud computing may be unacceptable. In addition to the
                    physical control, there is also the problem of reliability and availability. The purchaser is having
                    to rely upon the hosting service's ability to maintain system uptime and availability.

            <div class="content">Defense in Depth Concept:
                <p class="body">Due to the complexity of modern networks, malicious attackers have multiple avenues that
                    they can use to breach network security. The same complexity also allows for security to be placed
                    in multiple areas usingn different methods. By placing security at different levels and in different
                    places, network administrators can increase the overall security posture of a network. This concept
                    is known as defense in depth. Security should not just be placed in a single spot, as this creates a
                    single point of failure. Security should be emplaced at multiple layes of the newwork, using a
                    diversity of methods, in order to create an effectively hardened network.

                <p class="body">The DMZ is a specific area created --usually between two firewalls -- that allows
                    outside access to network resources (e.g., a web server), while the internal network remains
                    protected form outside traffic.

                <p class="body">NAT is a technique used to allow private IP addresses to be routed across, or through,
                    and untrusted public network. The NAT device --usually a router-- assigns a public routable IP
                    adress to a device that is requesting outside access. NAT has the added benefit of protecting the
                    interal private network. The private network's IP addressing scheme is hidden from untrusted
                    networks by the NAT enabled router.

                <p class="body">NAC is a method of controlling who and what gains access to a wired or wireless network.
                    In most cases, NAC usses a combination of credentials based security (e.g., 802.1X) and some form of
                    posture assessment for a device attempting to log on to the network. A posture assessment considers
                    the state of the requesting device. The device must meet a set of minimum standards before it is
                    allowed access to the network. Common device assessments include the type of device, operating
                    system, patch level of the operating system, the presence of anti-malware software and how up to
                    date it is.

                <p class="body"> Virtualization is the process of creating virtual resources instead of actual
                    resources. Hardware, operating systems, and complete networks can be virtualized. A security
                    advantage to virtualization is that, if the virtual resource is compromised, it can easily be taken
                    down, recoverd, fixed, and then brough back online.

                    discrete seperate networks. Can be done to match the physical structure of the network (e.g., the
                    network only requires enough addresses for 100 nodes, not 254). Can be done to increase the security
                    of the network by segmenting resources by needs and security level.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Segmentation of Resources:
                <p class="body">Security can be increased by segmenting a network based on resources and security needs
                    through the implementation of virtual local area networks (VLANs). The segmentation can be done
                    based on user groups (e.g., a VLAN for the sales department and another one for human resources).
                    the segmentation can be done based on user groups (e.g., a VLAN for the sales department and another
                    one for human resources). The segmentation can be done based on resource type (e.g., a VLAN for file
                    servers and another one for web servers). Commonly, segmentation is accomplished with a combination.
                    The use of VLANs supports a more secure, layered approach in the network design.

            <div class="content">Remote Access:
                <p class="body">In modern networks, it is not uncommon to need to allow remote access to local network
                    resources. Remote workers often need to acess resources that are located on the main buisness
                    network. This requires the use of remote access technology in order for it to happen in a secure
                    manner. Remote access can occur using telephony technology (e.g., dial-up) or through the use of a
                    virtual private network (VPN). In all cases, secure protocols and methods shouold be used in order
                    to ensure the security of the local network. For example, one of the forms of Extensible
                    Authenticaion Protocol (EAP) should be used when allowing remote access.

                <p class="body">With Internet protocols IPv4 still has dominance over IPv6 in the network. This will
                    change and it is already beginning to do so. Both IPv4 and IPv6 operate at Layer 3 (the network
                    layer) of the OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) model. Both IPv4 and IPv6 operate at the Internet
                    layer of the TCP/IP reference model. The protocols are similar in fuction and yet are different in
                    how they provide those functions. Both protocols are responsible for network adressing and routing
                    operations within a network. While IPv4 has performed these duties adequately for many years, IPv6
                    is slowly assuming those reponsibilities and will eventually be the dominant protocol.

                <p class="body">Wireless networks can represent a special challenege in the network hardening process.
                    End users will often install their own access point (AP) for convenience, allowing them to connect
                    to the network wirelessly on their own. These rogue APs can create a vulnerability in the network as
                    a whole. Conducting periodic site surveys, using a combination of hardware and software, can hep to
                    locate rogue AP's so they can be removed. Site surveys can also be used to ensure that wireless
                    network signals are only present where they should be. The only wireless signals that should be
                    present in any enviornment are those that are authorized.

            <div class="content">Risk Assessments:
                <p class="body">Many buisnesses dedicate a fair amount of their resources -both money and time- to
                    performing risk assessments. In most cases, the risk assessments may be broken into one of two
                    categories. They may be either qualitative or quantitative assessments. Qualitative assessments are
                    conducted based on the probablility, or likelihood, of the risk occuring and the expected impact on
                    the buisness. This type of assessment is not really concerned about the actual dollar impact.
                    Quantitatice assessments are conducted based on the projected cost in dollars if a risk even occurs.

            <div class="content">Qualitative Assessments:
                <p class="body">Basic formula: risk = probability/likelihood X loss/impact. Several tables are build
                    using the variables of the formulas. A risk table outlines the possible events (e.g., a data breach
                    or hard drive failure). A probability/likelihood table outlines the possibility of the event
                    ovvurring (e.g., not likely, likely, or most likely) with a value assigned to the likelihood. A
                    loss/impact table outlines the impact to the buisness if the event occurs (e.g., minor, medium, or
                    major) with a value assigned to the loss. The tables are used collectively to create the qualitative
                    risk assessment. Often, qualitative assessments are used to determine which assets and risks require
                    a quantitative risk assessment. Quantitative risk assessments require more time and effort.

                    assessments can help when budgeting for a security solution to reduce the risk of occurrence. Step
                    1: Determine the value of the asseet (may be the cost to replace the cost of downtime, etc.). Step
                    2: Determine the exposure factor (EF)-the cost of a threat event expressed as a percentage of the
                    value of the asses. Step 3: Determine the single loss expectancy (SLE) --the value multiplied by the
                    EF. Step 4: Determine the average rate of occurance (ARO) --the number of times the threat event is
                    estimated to occur each year. Step 5 Determine the average loss expectancy (ALE) --the SLE
                    multiplied by the ARO. Step 6: determine what security solution (that falls below the ALE) will
                    mitigate the risk.

                    place(i.e., that a security incident has occured). Most technicians, hopefully, will not need to
                    deal with a murder mystery in the workplace. However, it is almost certainty that they will have to
                    deal with some type of security or legal issue when supporting an organization's network. This will
                    often require using a first response that includes forensic procedures. The response to security and
                    legal issues needs to be done in a manner such that evidence is recorded and preserved. The first
                    step is recognizing that someting has occured which needs to be documented and that evidence needs
                    to be collected and preserved.

                    evaluate is the overall situation. The first step is to judge how widespread the incident is. It may
                    involve a single system or it may involve multiple PCs -possibly even an entire department. The
                    second main responsibility of the first responder is to isolate the incident and contain the damage.
                    In most cases, this can be effectively achieved by removing the affected system from the network (by
                    unplugging the network cable from the unit). If the damage is more widespread, it may be necessary
                    to power down a switch or other network device in order to contain the damage.

            <div class="content">Security Policy Creation:
                <p class="body">A security policy is actually composed of many sub-documents that cover the expected
                    behavior of personnel from a security perspective. It is created by personnel tasked with securing
                    company assets, but it also has the backing of management. Without management's backing, it's
                    difficult to enfore a security policy. All personnel should be required to be trained on the
                    security policy and then acknowledge such training with a signature. The individual sub-policies
                    contained within the security policy will not only detail the expected behavior, but will also
                    outline the disciplinary actions that can or will be taken if the policy is violated. Disciplinary
                    actions can range from a simple reprimand to termination or prosecution.

            <div class="content">Role-Based Security Training:
                <p class="body">When training on individual security policies, it is mportant to craft the training to
                    fit the intended user. General User: needs to know the what of the policy. Technical User: need to
                    know the how and what of the policy. Management: needs to know the why of the policy.

            <div class="content">Disaster:
                <p class="body">In the business world, a disaster is any event that involces more than the day to day
                    emergency response resources. It is a fact of life that disasters will happend. Any event that can
                    prevent an organization from functioning normally will have major impact on the continnued existence
                    of that buisness. The more time that is spent non-operational, the harder it becomes to recover from
                    a disaster. An organization should create a disaster response plan (DRP) in order to address these
                    situations. The DRP needs to be a comprehensive plan that covers everything from the unfortunate
                    loss of key personnel to the loss of a critical business site.
                </p>

            <div class="content">Cold Site:
                <p class="body">A pre-arranged location that an organization can utilize in the case of a disaster. It
                    is a backup space only. No IT infrastructure is maintained in placae. In the case of a disaster, the
                    business moves all personel, systems, and equipment to the site. It is the least expensive backup
                    site to maintain. It is the hardest type of backup site to bring up to speed.

                    networking equipment). In the case of a disaster, the business moves all personnel, systems, and
                    other necessary equipment to the site. It is less expensive than a hot site and usually only
                    requires the addition of the latest backups to get systems back up and running. It is more expensive
                    than a cold site and takes more time to bring up to speed than a hot site.

            <div class="content">Importance of Data Backups:
                <p class="body">Data plays an extremely important role in the life of organizations. They may live or
                    die based on the data that they need to utilize. This importance requires that data be kept and
                    maintained safely. Without it, ost organization will not be able to operate until it can be
                    recreated. This means that data backup plans and procedures are a vital part of any DRP. Backups
                    should be stored off site in order to safeguard against a disaster. Backups also play a key role in
                    recovering from unexpected consequences or from the failure of a component. Backup schedules must be
                    implemented, and periodic tests should be conducted to ensure that the backup process is working.

            <div class="content">Differential Backups:
                <p class="body">Only data that has changed since the last full backup is saved. Time to backup is
                    moderate, requires a moderate amount of storage, but also is the middle ground on the length of time
                    for recovery. Recovery requires the last full backup file and the last differential backup file.

                    device (e.g., a router or switch) has been configured and is operating as expected, a backiup of the
                    configuration files and operating system should be created. This helps to speed up the recovery time
                    in cases of equipment failure, or when a change to configuration has unexpected consequences.

                <p class="body">Building fault tolerance into IT systems is a main tactic used to remove sinle points of
                    failure and to ensure high availability of data. Using a single server (or other peice of hardware)
                    to
                    run and maintain critical business functions represents a huge risk. If that server (or other piece
                    of
                    hardware) were to fail, it would have a severe impact on the operations of an organization. Fault
                    tolerance is the process of putting systems and processes inplace to reduce the impact of the
                    failure of
                    any system (it can also be used to mitigate against the loss of a group of systems).

                    of the data or processes. If a single node fails, operations continue uninterrupted. Has the
                    advantage
                    of allowing for load balancing. As all the nodes contain current information, during peak periods,
                    the
                    workload may be spread out among the various nodes. The cluster may be contained within a single
                    facility, or it may be goegraphically disbused. Geographic distribution has the added benefit of

                    in most cases, they are deployed seperately to achieve the goal. It is not uncommon for the
                    categories to work together to increase the overall security of the data and systems. When the focus
                    is on systems and data, the security control can be placed into one of three categories. The

                    have adequate lighting), and outside threats (e.g., controlling access to the facility). The

            <div class="content">Summary:
                <p class="body">Quite often, an attacker will use a sniffer type attack in order to determine what type
                    of attack to use on a neetwork. Sniffer attacks use speecialzed software t examine the network for
                    vulnerabilities. The software may conduct a port scan-looking for either open or vulnerable ports
                    that can be exploited. Or, the software may be used to examine network packets in order to determine
                    what applications, protocols, and services are in use on the network. A common port scanning attack
                    is the XMAS scan. With the XMAS scan, each packet sent by the scanner has three of the six possible
                    flags set (so it is lit up like a christmas tree) in order to keep the scan from being discovered.

            <div class="content">Passwords:
                <p class="body">Unfortunately, end user passwords often present an attacker with an easy entry into the
                    network. Even when network administers try to create a strong password policy, end users often
                    attempt to create easy to remember passwords. Usually, if the passowrd is easy to remember, it is
                    easy to crack. In studies conducted on passwords, some of the most common include: 12345678,
                    passoword,qwerty, and letmein. These do not represent much of a challenge to the hacker. Attackers
                    also have other tools that they can use in a password attack.

            <div class="content">Trust:
                <p class="body">The largest vulnerability in any system tends to be the people who have authorized acess
                    to the system itself. Hackers often attempt to exploit this weakness in the system by applying
                    social pressure to the people who have access to the system. It has been proven to be an effective
                    means of breaching data security for many years, as it relies upon some well known exploitation
                    principles. In actuality, social engineering doesn't require very much technology in order to be
                    effective. Even the NSA was proven to be vulnerable to social engineering attacks. It was the main
                    method used by Edward Snowden to gather the illicit data he took from the organization.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Authority:
                <p class="body"> The hacker impersonates an authority figure, the victim believes that he or
                    she must comply with the authority. the impersonation can occur through email, over the phone, or
                    even in person.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Consensus/Social Proof:
                <p class="body">The hacker presents some know facts as proof that he or she is telling the trush; the
                    victim ends up trusting the attacker based on the social proof.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Scarcity:
                <p class="body">The attacker persuades the victim that what is being offered is highly valued due to its
                    scarcity. The target falls victim to human nature (usually greed) --the Nigerian Prince scam.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Urgency:
                <p class="body">The hacker imparts a sense of situational urgency; the victim feels like he or
                    she has to act now to fix a situation. The message delivered may arrive via the telephone or email,
                    but it always implies that action is required now in order to aver disaster.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Familiarity:
                <p class="body">The attacker either uses a friendly tone or inserts himself/herself into the workplace;
                    the victims tend to like the attacker or feel that they can trust the attacker. This is one of the
                    main methods Edward Snowden used to gain access to the information he took from the NSA.

            </div>
            <div class="content">Trust:
                <p class="body">The hacker exploits our human nature to trust -either by appearing to need the
                    victim's help, or by offering to help the victim. By appearing to be the victim of an unfortunate
                    situation, the attacker fools the victim into succumbing to the attack. The hacker may create a
                    situation in which the victim appears to need the attacker's help.

            <div class="content">Impersonation:
                <p class="body">Many social engineering attacks begin with the hacker using impersonation -the act of
                    pretending to be somebody else. A common impersonation technique is where the attacker impersonates
                    someone of perceived authority, causing the victim to feel as if he or she must comply. The attacker
                    may impersonate someone who requires help; for example, the attacker pretends to be an end user who
                    requires the assistance of a network administrator.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Phising:
                <p class="body">The hacker typically casts out a broad net of emails that appear to be from a trusted
                    source (e.g., well known bank or Google) requesting users click on a hyperlink. The hyperlink
                    connects to a malicious website and , when the user inputs his or her credentials (as requested),
                    the attacker then steals the user's credentials. The phising attack may employ the principles of
                    authority and urgency in order to get the victim to respond.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Whaling:
                <p class="body">Very similar to a phising attack; however, instead of casting a wide net in order to get
                    a few responses, the hacker targets a whale or big fish -somebody with alot to lose. The hacker
                    specifically creafts the message(s) to suit the victim's situation. The usual target is someone at
                    the executive level of an organization.

            <div class="content">Hoax:
                <p class="body">Employs the principle of consensus/social proof in order to get the victim to perfrom an
                    action. Most hoaxes are not targeted to a specific person or organization, but are crafted in order
                    to cause disruption. Often a hoax is perpetuated by users who don't realize it is a hoax.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Shoulder Surfing:
                <p class="body">A type of social engineering attack that relies upon the hacker being able to see the
                    victim's screen or keyboard. The hacker tries to steal confidential information (often a username
                    and passwork) by watching the victim's action.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Dumpster Diving:
                <p class="body">The attacker goes through the trash of a person or organization in an effort to discover
                    sensitive information. A cross-cut shredder is more effective than a strip-cut shredder (shredded
                    material can actually be pieced back together).

            <div class="content">Tailgating:
                <p class="body">A social engineering attack that is usually used to bypass physical security. The

                <p class="body">Often, the hacker's goal when attacking an application is to create the ability to

                    was not designed to execute the code. If the attacker can gain this ability, the code will often be
                    executed at an administrative account level. Arbitrary code execution/remote code execution
                    represents an extreme security risk, as it often has the ability to make changes to th eunderlying
                    system. When this occurs, it can be difficult to discover and stop.

                    all to often, they are not reviewed until after a security incident has occurred. By carefully
                    establishing the parameters that will be logged, and properly training personnel on how to review
                    the logs, security can be enhanced. Even if an incident occurs, there is a greater possibility of it
                    being discovered earlier if log files are reviewed on a regular basis. The earlier an incident is
                    discovered the easier it will be for the response team to contain the damage.

                    to find weaknesses in a network. It is usually conducted using protocl analyzers (also called packet
                    sniffers) and port scanners. These applicatoins can be used to determine which protocols and
                    services are being used on a network. Protocol analyzers can also be used to determine which ports
                    are open on a network. This information can be used by security experts to help harden the network
                    against attack. Vulnerability scanning does not attempt to exploit any weaknesses that are found. It
                    only identifies them for the security personnel.
                </p>
                <p class="body">
                    The purpose is to assess the configuration of systems and networks to determine what can be done to
                    increase the level of security. This is done passively by collecting information andn reporting on
                    the information collected in a non=intrusive manner. The scan can help to identify different issues:
                    Lack of security controls, common misconfigurations, etc. Two different types of vulnerability scans
                    should be conducted. As an authorized user -a credential scan should be conducted from an
                    administrative account. As an unauthorized -a noncredential scan should be conducted to determine
                    what an unauthorized us may find out about a system. A false positive may be reported by
                    vulnerability scans. Something reported as a vulnerability that isn't actually one.

            <div class="content">Penetration Testing:
                <p class="body">Also known as pen testing is actively seeking to find vulnerabilities in networks and
                    systems that can be exploited. Once a weakness is found, the pen tester then attempts to exploit the
                    vulnerability. Many organization use pen testing as a means of increasing the security of their
                    organizations; however, hackers also use pen testing as a means of finding networks and systems they
                    can exploit. As a result, every secyrity expert must be sure to receive explicit authorization to
                    perform pen testing before beginning the test. If such authorization is not obtained, a security
                    expert could face dire consequences. Unauthorized pen testing is, in actuality illegal -as its a
                    form of hacking.

                    The purpose is to assess the security of a system or network by actually using the same methods that
                    a hacker would use to breach security. The test can be used to verify that a threat exists. Can also
                    confirm that the threat doesn't exist. The test can be used to verify that a threat exists. Can also
                    confirm that the threat doesn't exist. The test seeks to actively test and bypass any security
                    controls that may be present. It is desiged to exploit any vulnerabilities that may be present on
                    the system or network. Unauthorized pen testing may lead to legal issues.

            <div class="content">Testing Security at Different Levels:
                <p class="body">It is vital that, when security tests are conducted on systems and networks, the testing
                    be conducted at a variety of levels. The first level of security testing should be done at the white
                    box level. While white box testing is when the person conduccting th test has the exact details of
                    the system or network; the tested has intimate knowledge of what is present and how it is
                    configured. The final level of security testing is done at the black box level. With black box
                    testing, the tester (usually a security exper) is given no prior knowledge of the configuration or
                    what is present.

        </div>
        <div class="subTopic">Secure Coding Concepts:
            <div class="content">Securing Software:
                <p class="body">Hackers will often focus on applications (software) when they are attempting to breach
                    network security. Because of this, application developers need t ofocus on security controls right
                    from the beginning of developing the application. This is the idea of using secure coding concepts.
                    An application designed with security in mind is much easier to defend then an applicatoin that
                    doesn't use such methods. Two of the main concepts of secure coding are error and exceptoin handling
                    and input validationn.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Error Handling:
                <p class="body">Thoroughly testing applications will catch most errors, with the possible exception of
                    some runtime errors. Runtime errors are problems that occur during the operation of an application.
                    Many things can cause a runtime error. They include poor programming, conflicts with other software
                    (including malicious applications), and conflicts with hardware. The developer should put processes
                    in place that trap all runtime errors before such an error crashes the application. Trapping a
                    runtime error requires that the developer intercept the error and display a warning message before
                    the error causes the application to crash.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Exception Handling:
                <p class="body">A more advanced method of error handling. An exception is a different term for a runtime
                    error. Exception handling code will use a try/catch block -try this code and catch any errors that
                    occur. Usually will provide a means of looping the program until the error condition subsides.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Input Validation:
                <p class="body">A major cause of runtime errors and other security issues in applications is users
                    inputting invalid data into the application. Secure coding requires that input validation be done
                    before that data is actually placed into the application. Input validation is when the uses supplied
                    data is examined against a set of rules that outline what type of data the applicatoin is expecting.
                    One method of testing input validation rules is to use fuzzing. During the testing phase of the
                    application, the developer will input invalid or random data into the input fields in order to test
                    the input validation rules.

            <div class="content">Client-Side and Server-Side Validation:
                <p class="body">Initial input validation should occur on the client (requesting machine) before it is
                    sent to the application on the server. This can help to prevent a runtime error or exploit on the
                    server and reduces the amount of traffic that is crossing a network. Additional input validation
                    should occur at the server (receiving machine) before the input is passed on to the application
                    -further reducing the chances of a runtime error or an exploit occuring.

                    users access the form, the script is executed. Proper input validation of data is usually an
                    effective means of preventing XSS from occuring.

                <p class="body">Most modern game consoles can be connected to networks. In many cases, the console must
                    be connected to the network in order to take advantages of gaming features. Security features for
                    gaming consoles has been increasing. All updates should be in place for any gaming console that is
                    placed on a network.

            <div class="content">Mainframes:
                <p class="body">High cost; powerful computing systems that contain significant processing power. Due to
                    their cost, mainframes are n ot replaced very frequently and may be using older versions of
                    operating systems -which may have well known vulnerabilities. Technological controls should be in
                    place to help secure mainframes. Firewalls, access control lists (ACLs), and door locks can all be
                    implemented to restrict access to the mainframe enviornment.

            <div class="content">In-Vehicle Computing Systems:
                <p class="body">Car manufacturers have been using processors in vehicles for many years. Initially, the
                    processors had limited capabilities and could prove difficult to exploit without physical access to
                    the vehicle. Modern vehicles are coming with more connected systems that may represent a challenge
                    to security. In july 2015, a security team demonstrated the ability to take over a vehicle's systems
                    remotely, including the ability to take control of the braking system.

                    effectiveness of security. Found in Linux and UNIX enviornments and can be used to specify how an
                    individual host can access a specific service (e.g., allowing Bob access to SCP but not to FTP on
                    the file server).

            <div class="content">Importance of Variety:
                <p class="body">When implementing a layered security mitigation technique, it is important to use a
                    variety of products. If all of the firewalls used in the layered approach are the same product, then
                    they will more than likely all have the same vulnerability. Once an attacker breaches one firewall,
                    the res will likely fall in short order. A best practice is to implement a diversity of products for
                    security considerations (e.g., different firewall devices). If different products are used, then the
                    hacker has to figure out how to get past each individual product, and the attacker cannot rely on
                    the same vulnerability being present in each device.

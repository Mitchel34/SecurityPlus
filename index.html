            <p class="body">
                7-Layered approach to networking. Security can be placed in between each layer.
                The Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model was developed as a way
                to help disparate computing systems communicate with each other.

        <div class="subTopic">Basic Network Devices
            <div class="content">Switch
                <p class="body">A switch utilizes an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC) chip and is
                    considered
                    a Layer 2 OSI device.
                    The ASIC chip has specific programing that allows the switch to learn when a device is on the
                    network and which ports it is
                    connected to via that device's Layer 2 MAC address.<br>
                    Managed switches allow security to be placed on the individual switch ports creating amore secure
                    networking enviornment. <br>
                    A switch will only communicate with local network devices.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Wireless Access Point (WAP)
                <p class="body">A WAP is a specific type of network bridge that connects (bridges) wireless network
                    segments with
                    wired network segments and is considered a Layer 2 OSI device.<br>
                    The most common type of WAP bridges 802.11 wireless network segments with 802.3 ethernet network
                    segments.<br>
                    All WAP's are capable of utilizing encryption to help ensure a secure networking envionrnment.<br>
                    A WAP will only communicate with local network devices.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Multilayer Swtch (MLS)
                <p class="body">An MLS provides normal Layer 2 network switchig services, but it will also proved Layer
                    3
                    or higher OSI model
                    services. <br>
                    The most common MLS is a Layer 3 switch. <br>
                    It not only untilizes and ASIC chi for switching, but the ASIC chip is also programmed to handle
                    routing functions.
                    This allows the device to communicate and pass data to non-local network devices</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Router
                <p class="body">The Router is the most common network device for connecting different networks together
                    utilizing the OSI
                    model's Layer 3 logical network information. <br>
                    The router uses software programming for decision making, as compared to the switch;s use of an ASIC
                    chip. <br>
                    Firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) are commonly placed on routers to help secure networks.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Firewalls
                <p class="body">A firewall can be placed on routers or hosts (software based) or an be its own device
                    (network appliance)<br>
                    It functions at multiple layers of the OSI model (Usually 2,3,4,and 7)<br>
                    It blocks packets from entering or leaving the network via stateless inspection and stateful
                    inspection. <br>
                    Stateless Inspections: the fire wall will examine every packet against a set of rules. Once the
                    packet matches a rule, the rule
                    is enforced, and the specified action is taken.<br>
                    Stateful Inspections: The firewall will only examine the state of the connection between networks.
                    Specifically, when a connection
                    is made from an internal network to an external, the firewall will not exammine any packets
                    returning from the external connection.
                    As a general rule, external connections are not allowed to be initiated with the internal
                    network.<br>
                    It is the first line of defense in protecting the internal network from outside threats. (consider
                    it the police force of the network)
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Load Balancer
                <p class="body">A load balancer may also be called a content switch or content filter. <br>
                    Can be implemented to increase the security of the network by limiting or filtering the content that
                    is allowed. <br>
                    A network appliance that is used to load balance between multiple hosts that contain the same
                    data-spreading out the
                    workload for greater efficiency.<br>
                    Commonly used to distribute the requests (workloads) to a server farm among the various servers,
                    helping to ensure
                    that no single server gets overloaded.

            </div>
            <div class="content"> Proxy Server
                <p class="body">A proxy server is an appliance that requests resources on behalf of client machines.<br>
                    It is often used to retrieve resources from outside untrusted networks on behalf of the requesting
                    client. <br>
                    It hides and protects the requesting client. <br>
                    It can also be utilized to filter allowed content. <br>
                    It can increase network performance by caching commonly requested web pages.

        <div class="subTopic">Layered Security Concept
            <div class="content">Layered Security Concept
                <p class="body"> Modern networks are composed of multiple layers of devices and applications, which can
                    lead to issues with security.<br> While this does make the issue of security more complex, it has
                    the
                    benefit of supporting the concept of layered security (which is also called security in depth.) <br>
                    Each layer or device can contain its own security methods. This means that if a breach occurs in one
                    area of the network, the rest of the network will remain secure (hopefully). <br>It is a best
                    practice to use a layered approach when implementing network security.<br> Many security devices are
                    triggered by a specific action occuring (e.g., a network packet crosses an interface).<br> This
                    creates a situation in which those devices are only capable of reacting to perceived threats.<br> On
                    the other hand, some devices are capable of application awareness. This feature allows security
                    devices to make better decisions based on which applications are alled to operate on the network and
                    which applications are not allowed to cross through it. This is another layer that can be added to
                    the network's security. Some devices that may be application aware include firewalls, proxy servers,
                    and network intrusion detection/prevention systems.

            <div class="content">VPN Concentrator (Virtual Private Network)
                <p class="body">A virtual private network (VPN) concentrator will facilitate multiple secure VPN
                    connections to a network. <br> The type of VPN connection to the network will determine what
                    tunneling and encryption the VPN concentrator will implement. Most concentrators can function at
                    multiple layers of the OSI model (2, 3, 7). <br> Outside of Internet transactions (which use SSL,
                    VPN connections at Layer 7), most concentrators will function at the network layer (Layer 3) of the
                    OSI model, providing IPsec encryption through a secure tunnel.
                </p>

            <div class="content">Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
                <p class="body">A NIDS is a passive system designed to identify when a network breach or attack against
                    the network is occuring.<br> Usually designed to inform a network administrator when a breach or
                    atack has occured through log files, SMS, and/or and email notification.<br>A NIDS cannot prevent or
                    stop a breach or attack on its own. <br> It receives a copy of all traffic and evaluates it against
                    a set of standards.<br>Signature Based: evaluates network traffic for known malware or attack
                    signatures.<br>Anomaly Based: evaluates network traffic for suspicious changes. <br> Policy Based:
                    evaluates network traffic against a specific declared security policy. <br> Heuristic Based:
                    evaluates network traffic against past network behavior (looks for changes in expected patterns).
                    <br>A NIDS deployed at the host level is called a Host Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS).

            <div class="content">Network Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS)
                <p class="body">Network Based Intrusion Prevention System (NIPS).<br> A NIPS is an active system
                    designed to stop a breach or atack from succeeding in damaging the network. <br>Usually designed to
                    perform an action or set of acions to stop malicious activity.<br> Will inform a network admin
                    through the use of log files, SMS, and/or email notification. <br> All traffic on the network
                    segment flows through the NIPS to either enter or leave the segment.<br> Like the NIDS, all traffic
                    is evaluated against a set of standards. <br> The best placement on the network is between a router
                    (with a firewall) and the destination network segment. <br> It is programmed to make an active

            <div class="content">Risks of Integration:
                <p class="body">There are multiple reasons why systems and data may be integrated with third parties.
                    The key is to know the risks. Systems and data may be required to be intedgrated because of a joint
                    venture with another entity. When implementing a cloud computing soluction, there will be a need to
                    integrate systems and data. In some cases, the need for integration is well known and intentional,
                    while, in other cases, it may not even be recognized as happening. When people are using social
                    media, they may actually be integrating company data with a third party. In all cases, there are
                    risks, associated with integration of systems and data with third parties.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Risk Awareness:
                <p class="body">Always evalate the risks when thinking about integrating systems and
                    data with third parties. Data may reside out of the control of the buisness. Network transmissions
                    may be vulnerable. The other side of the integration may not be secure. The third party may go out
                    of buisiness.

            <div class="content">Onboarding and Offboarding of Buisiness Partners:
                <p class="body">Procedures and systems need to be put in place that will allow authorized people from
                    the third party buisiness partner to access the appropriate systems and data --the onboarding
                    process. Implementing an identity accessmanagement (IAM) system can help ease the burden. Procedures
                    and systems also need to be put in place to remove access once the partnership is terminated or
                    authorized person leaves the buisness partner --the offboarding process.

                    If the risks of integration
                    are deemed acceptable, some additional agreements should be created to help the process. Memorandum
                    of understanding (MOU): A document that is created that establishes an agreement between two
                    parties. Blanket purchase agreement(BPA): a document created and used to cover repetitive needs for
                    products or services. Service level agreement (SLA): an agreement that specifies the guaranteed
                    uptime of a system. Internet service agreement (ISA): specifies any data limits placed on an
                    internet connection and should also contain a guarantee of the amount of uptime of the Internet
                    connection.

                    storage for the backups-- mitigating the risk of data loss in the case of disaster. A risk
                    associated with this is the loss of control of the data; all backups stored offsite should be

                    There needs to be a clear understanding of data ownership before
                    integration of systems and data is undertaken. Some third parties consider all data stroed on their
                    systems as being their data -- no matter where it originated from.

                    inappropiate to integrate data with a third party, it may actually be in violation of the

                    Social media represents a type of data integration that may be
                    difficult to control. With the increased use of social media networks and applications, company data
                    may not neccessarily be under control of the proper entities. Companies should strive to train
                    personnel on what is appropriate to share on social media, and what should not be placed out in the
                    open. It is possible for snesitive company information to be placed on the internet through the use

                <p class="body">Due to improvements in modern network security methods, hackers may not be able to
                    easily exploit network resources. As these security improvements have developed, in many cases
                    attackers have shifted their focus to application attacks. The hacker will focus on exploiting
                    weaknesses in the software and operating systems that people use everyday. In many cases, the
                    security used to protect software and from exploitation is not as robust as the security that is
                    used to protect newtworks. A poorly developed application can often give the hacker Administrative
                    control of a system if the exploit is executed properly.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack:
                <p class="body">The attacker inserts script code into a form on a web page that gets submitted to the
                    server. The server submits the scruipt code to another client system which the executes the script.
                    XSS is often used to attack the database serviers that are used to support web pages.
                </p>

            <div class="content">SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection Attack:
                <p class="body">SQL is a a common language used to manipulate databases. Most buisness and web
                    applications use SQL to retrieve data from databases. To perform the attack, the hacker inserts SQL
                    commands into the application, usually from an input field, knowing that the application will pass
                    the command to the database application. The injected SQL co mmands will then modify the
                    database (e.g., inserting new username and password for the hacker to use in further exploitation).

                    buffer can handle --overlflowing the buffer. The additional information will often be placed in
                    memory outside of the buffer. If the hacker can get the right information stored outside fo the
                    buffer, he or she can execute code with adminstrative privilege.

            <div class="content">Integer Overflow attack:
                <p class="body">Similar to a Buffer Overflow Attack; but involves exploiting the mathematical functions
                    of an application. When a mathematical function returns an integer larger than the memory space that
                    has been allocated to receive it, applications often respond in unexpected ways; this represents a
                    security issue.

            <div class="content">Directory Traversal/Command Injection Attack:

                    servers's directories to the point where he or she can execute commands on the underlying operating
                    system. The attacker manipulates the URL (Uniform Resource Locator) requests in order to move
                    through the directories and get to a command prompt on the underlying OS.

            <div class="content">Unknown Vulnerabilities (Zero Day Attacks):
                <p class="body">One of the largest threats that network security personnel face is the unkown
                    vulnerability. Network and systems administrators exlpend a fair amount of effort protecting the
                    assets under their control. They can do a good job of hardening their systems, but not a perfect
                    job. The problem lies with zero day attacks. Zero day attacks take advatage of either new or very
                    recently discovered vulnerabilities in applications, which means that networks and systems probably
                    haven't yet been hardened against them. The unfortunate reality is that attacks keep changing and
                    security experts must also be willing to adapt in order to keep pace.

            <div class="content">Data Validation:
                <p class="body">The best defense against application attacks begins with the application's developer.
                    Most attacks against applications involve exploiting outside input to the applications. By using
                    proper data validation techniques, application developers can stop most application attacks from
                    succeeding. All data validation techniques should be thoroughly tested by the developer to ensure
                    that they are effective. It is even advisable to have an unaffiliated person or organization attempt
                    to bypass the validation techniques in order to increase the effectiveness of the testting.

                    be a mix. Some departments may use IaaS, while a development team utilizes a PaaS only. Part of the
                    advantage of cloud computing is only initializing resources as they are needed. In a private cloud
                    situation, it is possible for the organization tha is using it to actually own the cloud resourves.
                    If they do own the cloud resourves, they may have it on site, or they may pay to have the resources

                    confidentiality. When the resources are out of physical control of the company, it may be difficult
                    to control access to those resources. In somesituations --such as when a law requires a company to
                    maintain physical control of the resources --cloud computing may be unacceptable. In addition to the
                    physical control, there is also the problem of reliability and availability. The purchaser is having
                    to rely upon the hosting service's ability to maintain system uptime and availability.

            <div class="content">Defense in Depth Concept:
                <p class="body">Due to the complexity of modern networks, malicious attackers have multiple avenues that
                    they can use to breach network security. The same complexity also allows for security to be placed
                    in multiple areas usingn different methods. By placing security at different levels and in different
                    places, network administrators can increase the overall security posture of a network. This concept
                    is known as defense in depth. Security should not just be placed in a single spot, as this creates a
                    single point of failure. Security should be emplaced at multiple layes of the newwork, using a
                    diversity of methods, in order to create an effectively hardened network.

            <div class="content">Demilitarized Zone (DMZ):
                <p class="body">The DMZ is a specific area created --usually between two firewalls -- that allows
                    outside access to network resources (e.g., a web server), while the internal network remains
                    protected form outside traffic.

                <p class="body">NAT is a technique used to allow private IP addresses to be routed across, or through,
                    and untrusted public network. The NAT device --usually a router-- assigns a public routable IP
                    adress to a device that is requesting outside access. NAT has the added benefit of protecting the
                    interal private network. The private network's IP addressing scheme is hidden from untrusted
                    networks by the NAT enabled router.

                <p class="body">NAC is a method of controlling who and what gains access to a wired or wireless network.
                    In most cases, NAC usses a combination of credentials based security (e.g., 802.1X) and some form of
                    posture assessment for a device attempting to log on to the network. A posture assessment considers
                    the state of the requesting device. The device must meet a set of minimum standards before it is
                    allowed access to the network. Common device assessments include the type of device, operating
                    system, patch level of the operating system, the presence of anti-malware software and how up to
                    date it is.

                <p class="body"> Virtualization is the process of creating virtual resources instead of actual
                    resources. Hardware, operating systems, and complete networks can be virtualized. A security
                    advantage to virtualization is that, if the virtual resource is compromised, it can easily be taken
                    down, recoverd, fixed, and then brough back online.

            <div class="content">Subnetting:

                    discrete seperate networks. Can be done to match the physical structure of the network (e.g., the
                    network only requires enough addresses for 100 nodes, not 254). Can be done to increase the security
                    of the network by segmenting resources by needs and security level.

            </div>
            <div class="content">Segmentation of Resources:
                <p class="body">Security can be increased by segmenting a network based on resources and security needs
                    through the implementation of virtual local area networks (VLANs). The segmentation can be done
                    based on user groups (e.g., a VLAN for the sales department and another one for human resources).
                    the segmentation can be done based on user groups (e.g., a VLAN for the sales department and another
                    one for human resources). The segmentation can be done based on resource type (e.g., a VLAN for file
                    servers and another one for web servers). Commonly, segmentation is accomplished with a combination.
                    The use of VLANs supports a more secure, layered approach in the network design.

            <div class="content">Remote Access:
                <p class="body">In modern networks, it is not uncommon to need to allow remote access to local network
                    resources. Remote workers often need to acess resources that are located on the main buisness
                    network. This requires the use of remote access technology in order for it to happen in a secure
                    manner. Remote access can occur using telephony technology (e.g., dial-up) or through the use of a
                    virtual private network (VPN). In all cases, secure protocols and methods shouold be used in order
                    to ensure the security of the local network. For example, one of the forms of Extensible
                    Authenticaion Protocol (EAP) should be used when allowing remote access.

                <p class="body">With Internet protocols IPv4 still has dominance over IPv6 in the network. This will
                    change and it is already beginning to do so. Both IPv4 and IPv6 operate at Layer 3 (the network
                    layer) of the OSI(Open Systems Interconnection) model. Both IPv4 and IPv6 operate at the Internet
                    layer of the TCP/IP reference model. The protocols are similar in fuction and yet are different in
                    how they provide those functions. Both protocols are responsible for network adressing and routing
                    operations within a network. While IPv4 has performed these duties adequately for many years, IPv6
                    is slowly assuming those reponsibilities and will eventually be the dominant protocol.

                <p class="body">Wireless networks can represent a special challenege in the network hardening process.
                    End users will often install their own access point (AP) for convenience, allowing them to connect
                    to the network wirelessly on their own. These rogue APs can create a vulnerability in the network as
                    a whole. Conducting periodic site surveys, using a combination of hardware and software, can hep to
                    locate rogue AP's so they can be removed. Site surveys can also be used to ensure that wireless
                    network signals are only present where they should be. The only wireless signals that should be
                    present in any enviornment are those that are authorized.

                    is to set the WAP to hide the SSID beaconing; this will prevent the casual user from seeing the
                    wireless network. Even with the beacon set to be hidden, with the proper hardware and software, an

            <div class="content">Risk Assessments:
                <p class="body">Many buisnesses dedicate a fair amount of their resources -both money and time- to
                    performing risk assessments. In most cases, the risk assessments may be broken into one of two
                    categories. They may be either qualitative or quantitative assessments. Qualitative assessments are
                    conducted based on the probablility, or likelihood, of the risk occuring and the expected impact on
                    the buisness. This type of assessment is not really concerned about the actual dollar impact.
                    Quantitatice assessments are conducted based on the projected cost in dollars if a risk even occurs.

            <div class="content">Qualitative Assessments:
                <p class="body">Basic formula: risk = probability/likelihood X loss/impact. Several tables are build
                    using the variables of the formulas. A risk table outlines the possible events (e.g., a data breach
                    or hard drive failure). A probability/likelihood table outlines the possibility of the event
                    ovvurring (e.g., not likely, likely, or most likely) with a value assigned to the likelihood. A
                    loss/impact table outlines the impact to the buisness if the event occurs (e.g., minor, medium, or
                    major) with a value assigned to the loss. The tables are used collectively to create the qualitative
                    risk assessment. Often, qualitative assessments are used to determine which assets and risks require
                    a quantitative risk assessment. Quantitative risk assessments require more time and effort.

                    assessments can help when budgeting for a security solution to reduce the risk of occurrence. Step
                    1: Determine the value of the asseet (may be the cost to replace the cost of downtime, etc.). Step
                    2: Determine the exposure factor (EF)-the cost of a threat event expressed as a percentage of the
                    value of the asses. Step 3: Determine the single loss expectancy (SLE) --the value multiplied by the
                    EF. Step 4: Determine the average rate of occurance (ARO) --the number of times the threat event is
                    estimated to occur each year. Step 5 Determine the average loss expectancy (ALE) --the SLE
                    multiplied by the ARO. Step 6: determine what security solution (that falls below the ALE) will
                    mitigate the risk.

                <p class="body">Cloud computing can create benefits to a buisiness. IT needs, including data storage,
                    can be offloaded, thus reducing costs. While this may be beneficial, careful thought must go the
                    into decision making process. This includes a thorough analysis of the risks that may be present. A
                    review of the provider's security is in order before any buisiness should place crucial data on a
                    cloud provider's system. The reliability of the provider's systems should also be evaluated to
                    ensure that availability meets the buisness requirements. Additionally, in some cases, data and
                    applications cannot reside on hosted systems because this may violate regulations.
